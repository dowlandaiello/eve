# Eve

Eve is a radically simplistic model of particle evolution based on three simple
processes: decay, procedural generation, and polling. In Eve, these processes
are carried out by and influence the actions of Eve's core component:
particles.

## Evolution

In Eve, evolution is represented by the emergence of some environmentally
or statistically superior particle. In the context of a simulation, statistical
superiority generally refers to the ability of a given particle to withstand
"decay" longer than its peers.

## The Macrocosm

Ultimately, Eve's purpose is to simulate. These "simulations" take place on
what one might describe as a three-dimensional "stage." In contrast with our
universe, events occur on this "stage" in an entirely linear fashion--that
is, properties of the "macrocosm" are never altered in a way that affects
certain parts of the simulation disproportionately. For this reason, these
three-dimensional simulations are referred to as "macrocosms."

In other words, a macrocosm is an ever-expanding, self-contained group of
particles. Each individual point in this three-dimensional body is
represented by a non-nil, functional particle (`c > 0 <= o`, where `c` is the
functional complexity of a particle and `o` is the operating functional
complexity of a particle).

## The Particle

Particles are the basis of evolution in Eve. What is a particle, one might ask?
In the case of an Eve simulation, a particle can be defined as a logically self
-contained agent that has a pre-determined, constant function that can be
expressed as an activation net with a size (functional complexity) proportional
to the decay rate of the particle.
