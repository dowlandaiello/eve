# Eve

Eve is a radically simplistic model of particle evolution based on three simple
processes: decay, procedural generation, and polling. In Eve, these processes
are carried out by and influence the actions of Eve's core component:
particles.

## Evolution

In Eve, evolution is represented by the emergence of some environmentally
or statistically superior particle. Furthermore, this "statistical superiority"
is defined as the ability of a given particle to withstand "decay" longer than
its peers.

### Terminology

In order to clear up any confusion with the aforementioned definition, let's
first describe the core components and terms associated with Eve:

- The "macrocosm"
  Ultimately, Eve's purpose is to simulate. These "simulations" take place on
  what one might describe as a three-dimensional "stage." In contrast with our
  universe, events occur on this "stage" in an entirely linear fashion. For this
  reason, these three-dimensional "simulations" are referred to as "macrocosms."
